## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 3.4, Vite 6 |
| Daemon | Node.js process — scanner engine, risk manager, trade execution, REST + WebSocket |
| Market Data | Alpaca IEX feed (bars, snapshots, news, WebSocket stream) |
| Paper Execution | Alpaca Paper Trading API (bracket orders) |
| Trade Persistence | `data/trades.json` — written by daemon, survives browser refreshes and reboots |
| Process Manager | pm2 — auto-restarts on crash, auto-starts on Windows login |
| Charting | TradingView widget + lightweight-charts (equity curve) |

---

## Running Locally

### First-time setup

```bash
npm install
npm install -g pm2 pm2-windows-startup

# Daemon env vars — copy and fill in your Alpaca paper keys
copy daemon\.env.daemon.example daemon\.env.daemon

# Build the daemon
npm run build:daemon

# Register pm2 to auto-start on Windows login (run once)
pm2-startup install

# Start both the daemon and the UI
npm run daemon:start
```

Open: `http://localhost:3006`

### Day-to-day

Nothing. Both processes start automatically when Windows starts. If you need to manually interact:

```bash
npm run daemon:status    # check daemon is running
npm run daemon:logs      # tail live logs
npm run daemon:restart   # rebuild daemon + restart (after code changes)
pm2 restart sutra-ui     # restart Vite UI (after UI code changes)
```

### One-time migration from localStorage (existing installs only)

If you have existing trades in the browser, export them before the first daemon start:

1. Open the Sutra tab in Chrome, open DevTools Console, run:
   ```js
   copy(JSON.stringify({
     trades:    JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('sutra.protrade.paperTrades.v1') || '[]'),
     riskState: JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('sutra.riskManager.v2')           || '{}'),
     settings:  JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('sutra.riskSettings.v1')          || '{}'),
     watchlist: JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('sutra.dayWatchlist.v1')           || '{}'),
   }, null, 2))
   ```
2. Paste the clipboard contents into `scripts/ls-export.json`
3. Run: `npm run migrate`

## Environment Variables

Two env files — one for the React UI, one for the daemon.

**`daemon/.env.daemon`** (required — daemon won't start without it):
```text
ALPACA_KEY=            # Alpaca paper API key ID
ALPACA_SECRET=         # Alpaca paper API secret
ALPACA_BASE_URL=https://paper-api.alpaca.markets
DAEMON_PORT=3001
DAEMON_AUTO_EXECUTE=false   # set to true to enable auto-trade firing
```

**`.env.local`** (optional — only needed if React components call Alpaca directly):
```text
VITE_ALPACA_KEY          # same paper key
VITE_ALPACA_SECRET       # same paper secret
VITE_ALPACA_DATA_URL     # optional — defaults to https://data.alpaca.markets
VITE_APP_NAME            # display name (default: Sutra)
```

## ProTrade — Seven Intraday Strategies

The core of Sutra is the ProTrade scanner, which evaluates a live universe of ~100 stocks against seven intraday strategies. Full scan runs every 60 seconds; a hot-set refresh (forming/confirmed/locked stocks only) runs every 20 seconds.

| Code | Strategy | Signal Type | Hard Gates |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | ORB Retest | Opening range breakout + controlled retest | direction, confirmedBreak, retest |
| S2 | VWAP Pullback | Trend continuation after VWAP reclaim | direction, touchedValue, reclaimed |
| S3 | RS Continuation | Relative strength vs SPY on micro range break | direction, breakout, rvol ≥ 1.0 |
| S4 | Liquidity Sweep | Stop-hunt reversal after OR sweep + reclaim | direction, swept, sweepWick, reclaimed, nearLevel |
| S5 | OB/FVG Retest | Order block or fair value gap retest with rejection | direction, hasStructure, fvgQuality, entryConfirmation |
| S6 | MSS Breakout | Market structure shift with clear path ahead | direction, mssOk, !zoneBlocked |
| S7 | Volume Surge | Institutional 2× volume spike on 15m range break | direction, volSpike ≥ 2×, isBreakout |

All other checks (VWAP context, RVOL, trend alignment, RSI, ADR room) are **informational** — visible in the checklist UI but never block execution.

### Gate Philosophy

Each strategy uses **2–3 hard gates maximum**. Hard gates represent the irreducible structural conditions for the setup. Everything else is context shown in the UI for human review.

### Workflow Stages

Stocks progress through: `raw_candidates → forming → confirmed → locked → trade_ready → ordered`

Only `trade_ready` rows trigger the auto-execute gate.

---

## Direction Logic

Per-stock direction is derived from the **15m EMA trend** (institutional timeframe, stable across the session):

```
trend15m = UP   → direction = BULL
trend15m = DOWN → direction = BEAR
gap% > +0.5%    → direction = BULL  (early session fallback)
gap% < -0.5%    → direction = BEAR  (early session fallback)
otherwise       → direction = NEUTRAL (no trade)
```

The 15m EMA is computed on the last 80 bars of 15m candle data, which includes yesterday's close. Direction is available from the first scan of the day.

---

## Macro Regime

The scanner classifies a daily macro regime from SPY's closing price vs its 200-day EMA and VIX level. This scales position size — not trade frequency.

| Regime | Condition | Size Multiplier |
|---|---|---|
| BULL | SPY > EMA200 and VIX < 20 | 1.0× |
| SIDEWAYS | SPY > EMA200 but VIX 20–30 | 0.75× |
| BEAR | SPY < EMA200 or VIX > 30 | 0.5× |

SPY daily bars (250 bars) are fetched once per session and cached for 1 hour. VIX is attempted via Alpaca IEX but not available on the free feed — regime falls back gracefully to SPY-only classification.

---

## Auto-Execute Gate

**S1 and S7 fire instantly** when `trade_ready` is detected — no 1m bar confirmation. These are momentum/gap strategies where delay means missing the move.

**S2–S6** wait for a 1-minute confirmation bar to close above (BULL) or below (BEAR) the structural entry level before placing a bracket order:

```
trade_ready detected (S2–S6)
    ↓
Enqueue symbol (level + direction recorded)
    ↓  (next scan cycle)
Fetch last closed 1m bar
    ↓
BULL: close > level AND volume ≥ 1.1× 20-bar avg → FIRE
BEAR: close < level AND volume ≥ 1.1× 20-bar avg → FIRE
    ↓
Unconfirmed setups expire after 5 minutes
```

---

## Stop Loss Architecture

Stops are computed per strategy using two constants:

| Constant | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `STOP_BUFFER_ATR` | 0.5× ATR20 | Structural buffer below/above anchor candle extreme |
| `NOISE_FLOOR_ATR` | 0.75× ATR20 | Minimum stop distance from entry — no stop tighter than this |

All strategies use `noiseFlooredStop()` to enforce the floor. Stops are always at least 0.75× the daily ATR away from entry.

### Two-Phase Trailing Stop (T1/T2)

| Event | Action |
|---|---|
| T1 hit (1.5R) | Scale out 50%, move stop to breakeven (entry) |
| Price pulls back to T1 zone (±0.3%) | Advance stop to T1 level |
| T2 hit (2.5R or structural PDH/PDL) | Close remaining position |

T2 is anchored to the previous day's high (BULL) or low (BEAR), capped at 3R and floored at 2.5R to prevent collapse.

---

## Session Gates

| Window | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Pre-market | All strategies locked |
| 9:30–9:45 AM ET (blackout) | All locked except S7 on gap ≥ 3% days |
| 9:45 AM–3:50 PM ET | Normal execution window |
| After 3:50 PM ET | No new entries |
| 3:57 PM ET | EOD flat-close — all open positions closed |

---

## Risk Management

- **Position sizing**: `(account × 2% risk) / |entry − stop|` shares, scaled by macro regime multiplier
- **Daily loss limit**: configurable (default 8% of starting equity) — blocks new entries if breached
- **Strategy circuit breaker**: 3 consecutive losses pause a strategy for 2 hours
- **Max concurrent positions**: configurable (default 5)
- **basePass filter**: price $1–$1500, ATR% 1.5–12%, dollar volume ≥ $3M — stocks failing this are not scanned

---

## WebSocket Bar Stream

Stocks at `forming`, `confirmed`, `locked`, or `trade_ready` stage are subscribed to Alpaca's real-time WebSocket bar stream. On each 5m bar close:

1. Bar cache for that symbol is evicted (snapshot cache preserved to avoid 429s)
2. Strategy signals are re-evaluated immediately
3. S7 (volume surge) is detected within seconds of the triggering bar closing

---

## Daemon Architecture

The daemon (`daemon/src/`) is a persistent Node.js process (pm2) that runs independently of the browser:

```
daemon/src/
  index.ts            # entry point — loads state, starts HTTP + scheduler
  httpServer.ts       # Express REST API (port 3001) + WebSocket push (/ws)
  scanLoop.ts         # full scan (60s) + hot-set scan (20s)
  scheduler.ts        # trade firing, EOD close, day-roll, circuit breakers
  alpacaBarStream.ts  # Alpaca real-time WebSocket bar stream
  engine/             # strategy evaluations, trade building, monitoring
  riskManager.ts      # daily loss limit, circuit breakers, position sizing
  stateStore.ts       # in-memory state with JSON persistence
```

The React UI connects via:
- `GET /api/state` — initial snapshot on load
- `ws://localhost:3001/ws` — push events (`snapshot_update`, `trade_opened`, `trade_closed`, etc.)
- REST calls for manual actions (paper trade, close, watchlist, unpause)

## Trade Persistence

Trades are written to `data/trades.json` by the daemon on every state change. The file survives browser refreshes, browser close, and system reboots. localStorage is no longer used for trade storage.

---

## Performance Analytics

The Performance tab tracks:

- **Win rate**: `Target` and `T1 Profit` are wins; `Stop` is a loss; `EOD` and `Manual` are excluded
- **Equity curve**: cumulative daily P&L as an SVG line chart
- **Daily P&L calendar**: heatmap grid by trading date
- **Strategy breakdown**: per-strategy trade count, W/L, and P&L
- **Intraday analytics**: profit factor, average R:R, average hold time, hour-of-day P&L

---

## Outcomes

| Outcome | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Target` | T2 hit — full position closed at target |
| `T1 Profit` | T1 hit — partial scale-out; remaining held to T2 or stopped at T1 |
| `Stop` | Structural stop hit — counts as loss |
| `Manual` | User closed from the monitor UI |
| `EOD` | System flat-closed at 3:57 PM ET — not counted as win or loss |

## API Rate Limit Notes (Alpaca IEX Free Tier)

- All market data calls are made by the daemon — the browser makes zero API requests
- Snapshot endpoint (`/v2/stocks/snapshots`) has the strictest rate limit
- Snapshot TTL is 30s — hot-set (20s cycle) reuses cached data on alternate cycles
- Bar cache is evicted on WebSocket bar close; snapshot cache is preserved
- Multiple browser tabs are now safe — they all read from the daemon, no duplicate scan cycles
- Stop any running `bt_run.mjs` or `diag_run.mjs` processes during live scanning (they hit the same rate limits)
